The Dutch LaTeX course I have given for the first time in the spring of 2011 as an activity of the ACM Antwerp Student Chapter. In the autumn of 2011 I am giving this course for the second time, centralizing its development here. Mainly some polishing will be done, the contents should stay the same.
